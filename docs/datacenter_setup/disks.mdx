# Disk Configuration

You may have one of the following setups:

- **Single disk setup**: CloudRift will work out of the box, and the single disk will be used for
  both the OS and virtual machine storage. Proceed to [Next Steps](#next-steps) if this is your setup.
- [Two-disk setup](#two-disk-setup): One disk for the system and a second disk for VM allocation.
- [Multiple disks setup](#multiple-disks-setup): One system disk and multiple additional disks that will be configured
  in a RAID array for VM allocation.


## Two-disk Setup

If you have two disks, you need to ensure that the second disk is properly mounted and formatted for CloudRift to use it for VM allocation.

### 0. Check the available disks

Run `lsblk` command to check available disks.

You should see something like this:
```
NAME                      MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
nvme0n1                   259:0    0 447.1G  0 disk
├─nvme0n1p1               259:1    0     1G  0 part /boot/efi
├─nvme0n1p2               259:2    0     2G  0 part /boot
└─nvme0n1p3               259:3    0 444.1G  0 part
  └─ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv 252:0    0   100G  0 lvm  /
nvme2n1                   259:4    0   3.5T  0 disk
```

In this example, `nvme0n1` is the system disk (with mountpoints) and `nvme2n1` is the second disk without a mount point.

If your second disk already has a mount point, you can skip to [Next Steps](#next-steps). Otherwise, continue with formatting and mounting.

### 1. Format the disk

Format the disk to EXT4 or your preferred filesystem.

```
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/nvme2n1
```

### 2. Mount the Disk

The mount point location is not important, but we recommend using `/media/cloudrift` so that you know
what this disk is being used for.

```
sudo mkdir -p /media/cloudrift
sudo mount /dev/nvme2n1 /media/cloudrift
```

### 3. Persist the Mount on Reboot

Add to `/etc/fstab`:

```
sudo udevadm trigger
UUID=$(blkid -s UUID -o value /dev/nvme2n1)
echo "UUID=$UUID /media/cloudrift ext4 defaults,nofail,discard 0 0" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
```

### 5. Verify Everything Works

```
sudo mount -a
df -h /media/cloudrift
```

It is also a good idea to perform a reboot and check run aforementioned commands to check that your
disks are persisted after the reboot.

## Multiple Disks Setup

Multiple disks will be formatted into RAID0 array and used for VM allocation.

### 0. Check the available disks

Run `lsblk` command to check available disks.

You should see something like this:
```
NAME                      MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
nvme0n1                   259:0    0 447.1G  0 disk
├─nvme0n1p1               259:1    0     1G  0 part /boot/efi
├─nvme0n1p2               259:2    0     2G  0 part /boot
└─nvme0n1p3               259:3    0 444.1G  0 part
  └─ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv 252:0    0   100G  0 lvm  /
nvme2n1                   259:4    0   3.5T  0 disk
nvme3n1                   259:5    0   3.5T  0 disk
nvme4n1                   259:6    0   3.5T  0 disk
nvme1n1                   259:7    0   3.5T  0 disk
```

### 1. Install mdadm

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y mdadm
```

### 2. Create the RAID array

Run the following command to create a RAID0 array. Replace device names appropriately:
```
sudo mdadm --create --verbose /dev/md0 --level=0 \
    --raid-devices=4 /dev/nvme1n1 /dev/nvme2n1 /dev/nvme3n1 /dev/nvme4n1
```

### 3. Watch it build (should be fast for RAID 0)

```
cat /proc/mdstat
```

### 4. Create a filesystem

Format the array to EXT4 or your preferred filesystem.
```
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/md0
```

### 5. Mount the array

The mount point location is not important, but we recommend using `/media/cloudrift` so that you know
what this disk is being used for.

```
sudo mkdir -p /media/cloudrift
sudo mount /dev/md0 /media/cloudrift
```

### 6. Persist on boot

Add to `/etc/fstab`:

```
sudo udevadm trigger
UUID=$(blkid -s UUID -o value /dev/md0)
echo "UUID=$UUID /media/cloudrift ext4 defaults,nofail,discard 0 0" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
```

### 7. Verify Everything Works

```
sudo mount -a
df -h /media/cloudrift
```

It is also a good idea to perform a reboot and check run aforementioned commands to check that your
disks are persisted after the reboot.

## Next Steps

To test the node configuration and make your nodes rentable, proceed to the [Memory Configuration](./memory) guide.
