# Getting Started

CloudRift Datacenter Service is a system service that connects to the CloudRift platform, allowing
you to manage and lease your datacenter computational resources. Together with CloudRift CLI,
REST API, and other developer tools, it provides a comprehensive solution for managing your datacenter.

## Node Operation Modes

CloudRift nodes can operate in three distinct modes, depending on your infrastructure and requirements.
Please proceed to the next step accordingly to your needs.

- [Docker Mode](./docker): Run containerized workloads using Docker Engine. This is the most common setup for GPU and CPU resource sharing.
- [Virtual Machine (VM) Mode](./vm): Serve virtual machines using Libvirt and QEMU/KVM. Suitable for scenarios requiring full VM isolation or custom OS environments.
- **Bare Metal Mode** (Coming Soon): Lease entire physical machines directly, without virtualization or containers. Ideal for maximum performance or specialized hardware needs.

You can configure your node to support one or more of these modes based on your use case.

**Coming Soon:** CloudRift will soon support MAAS (Metal-as-a-Service) for automated bare metal provisioning and management.
