# Configure Rift Service

Once you have configured the machine for either [Docker], [VM] or Bare Metal (coming soon) rental - install and configure
Rift system service.

## Sign Up & Activate the Account

To start using CloudRift, please sign up at [cloudrift.ai](https://cloudrift.ai).

## Configuring Rentable Machines

:::info

All steps below are included in our setup script, which can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/cloudrift-ai/rift-utils).

:::

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure your system has the following tools installed. These are required for downloading scripts, managing permissions, and installing packages.

- `curl`: For downloading scripts and files.
- `sudo`: For running commands as root.

```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y curl sudo
```

### CloudRift System Service

Any Linux distribution is supported, but we typically test on Ubuntu 22.04.

```shell
curl -L https://cloudrift.ai/install-rift-service.sh | sudo sh
```

#### 1. CloudRift CLI

Install CloudRift CLI to configure the system service.

```shell
curl -L https://cloudrift.ai/install-rift.sh | sh
```

#### 2. Configure Credentials

Configure credentials using the rift command line tool by running:

```shell
sudo rift configure
```

:::note

We're running the rift system service as root, so we need to configure it as root.

:::

You can also edit the config manually. It is located at `/root/.config/cloudrift/credentials.yml`.

:::info

If editing manually, ensure you have the correct permissions and YAML formatting.

:::

#### 3. Restart System Service and Check Status

Restart CloudRift system service and check the status of the service and Docker Engine.

```shell
sudo systemctl restart rift
sudo systemctl status rift
sudo systemctl status docker
```

:::tip
You can use [client_setup.sh](https://github.com/cloudrift-ai/rift-utils/blob/main/scripts/client_setup.sh) to install and configure rift service:

```shell
sudo client_setup.sh --only=rift
```

:::

## Testing CloudRift Setup

### 1. Install CloudRift CLI

Install CloudRift CLI on your local machine. Installation instructions vary depending on your OS.

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="win" label="Windows">
    <DownloadWindowsInstaller/>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="mac" label="Mac">

  ```shell
  curl -L https://cloudrift.ai/install-rift.sh | sh
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

  ```shell
  curl -L https://cloudrift.ai/install-rift.sh | sh
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 2. Configure Credentials

Configure your credentials using the rift command line tool by running:

```shell
rift configure
```

### 3. Inspect the Cluster

Inspect the cluster. You should see all machines that you've installed CloudRift service on:

```shell
rift cluster info
```

### 4. Run Your First Job

If you have configured the machine for Docker - you can test it immediately. Otherwise, contact us and we'll help
you to configure the console for VM rental.

Run your first job. For example, to run a simple echo command:

```shell
rift docker run --rm alpine echo "Hello CloudRift"
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Docker or NVIDIA driver issues:** Ensure you have rebooted after installation or removal of drivers. Check `nvidia-smi` and `docker info`.
- **Permission errors:** Make sure you are running commands as root or with `sudo`.
- **Service not starting:** Check logs with `sudo journalctl -u rift` or `sudo systemctl status rift`.

## Next Steps
