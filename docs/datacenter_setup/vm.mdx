# Setup for VM

If your node will serve virtual machines, you need to install and configure Libvirt and Qemu.

To allow Libvirt to use GPU device in pass-through mode, you have to make sure the NVIDIA driver is not installed or not used by the system.

## 0. Check NVIDIA Driver Installation

You can check if the NVIDIA driver is loaded and used by the system using the following command:

```shell
lsmod | grep nvidia
# or check if driver is used by your GPU:
lspci -k | grep -EA3 'VGA|3D|Display'
```

## 1. Remove NVIDIA Driver (if installed)

If the NVIDIA driver is installed, you can remove it using the following command:

```shell
sudo apt-get remove --purge '^nvidia-.*'
sudo apt autoremove
echo 'nouveau' | sudo tee -a /etc/modules
sudo rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf
```

:::info

Restart your machine to apply the changes.

## 2. Install System Dependencies

Install additional packages required by the service.

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon-system genisoimage whois
```

## 3. Configure Libvirt

Rift system service is run as the root user, so you need to set up libvirt to run under root as well.
Edit `/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf` and modify the `user` and `group` settings:

```shell
user = "root"
group = "root"
```

Then restart the `libvirtd` service:

```shell
sudo systemctl restart libvirtd
```

:::tip
You can use [client_setup.sh](https://github.com/cloudrift-ai/rift-utils/blob/main/scripts/client_setup.sh) to install libvirt and rift:

```shell
sudo client_setup.sh --only=vm
sudo client_setup.sh --only=rift
```

## Next Steps

To test the node configuration and make your nodes rentable, proceed to [CloudRift System Service Setup](./system_service).
