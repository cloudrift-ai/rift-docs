# Setup for VM

If your node will serve virtual machines, you need to install and configure Libvirt and Qemu.

To allow Libvirt to use GPU device in pass-through mode, you have to make sure the NVIDIA driver is not installed or not used by the system.

## 0. Check NVIDIA Driver Installation

You can check if the NVIDIA driver is loaded and used by the system using the following command:

```shell
lsmod | grep nvidia
# or check if driver is used by your GPU:
lspci -k | grep -EA3 'VGA|3D|Display'
```

## 1. Remove NVIDIA Driver (if installed)

If the NVIDIA driver is installed, you can remove it using the following command:

```shell
sudo apt-get remove --purge '^nvidia-.*'
sudo apt autoremove
echo 'nouveau' | sudo tee -a /etc/modules
sudo rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf
```

If you've installed the driver using the RUN file, remove it using:
```shell
sudo /usr/bin/nvidia-uninstall
```

Remove configs if any.
```shell
sudo rm -rf /etc/X11/xorg.conf
sudo rm -rf /etc/modprobe.d/nvidia*.conf
sudo rm -rf /lib/modprobe.d/nvidia*.conf
```

After the reboot, verify that driver is uninstalled. The following command should return nothing:
```
lsmod | grep nvidia
```

:::info

Restart your machine to apply the changes.

## 2. Install System Dependencies

Install additional packages required by the service.

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon-system genisoimage whois
```

## 3. Configure Libvirt

Rift system service is run as the root user, so you need to set up libvirt to run under root as well.
Edit `/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf` and modify the `user` and `group` settings:

```shell
user = "root"
group = "root"
```

Then restart the `libvirtd` service:

```shell
sudo systemctl restart libvirtd
```

:::tip
You can use [client_setup.sh](https://github.com/cloudrift-ai/rift-utils/blob/main/scripts/client_setup.sh) to install libvirt and rift:

```shell
sudo client_setup.sh --only=vm
sudo client_setup.sh --only=rift
```

## 4. (Optional) Enable iommu=pt pci=realloc options

The iommu=pt and pci=realloc kernel parameters in GRUB are used to optimize I/O operations and improve performance,
particularly in virtualized environments or when dealing with GPUs with large amount of memory. The iommu=pt option
enables IOMMU pass-through mode, bypassing DMA translation for better performance, while pci=realloc allows the kernel
to reallocate PCI resources if the BIOS's initial allocation is insufficient.

Add `iommu=pt pci=realloc` the following line in the `/etc/default/grub`.
```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="... iommu=pt pci=realloc"
```

Then, invoke (or do it after the next section).
```
sudo update-grub
sudo update-initramfs -u
sudo reboot
```

## 5. (Optional) Ensure that GPU is not Used by the System

Libvirt automatically binds the VFIO driver when VM is being allocated, but for greater stability it is
best to ensure that VFIO driver is always bound and no driver changes are happening at runtime. Thus, first
blacklist all other drivers early and disable video mode setup to ensure that the GPU is not used by the system.

Add `nomodeset video=efifb:off modprobe.blacklist=nouveau,nvidia,nvidiafb` the following line in the `/etc/default/grub`.
Keep other options if needed.
```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="... nomodeset modprobe.blacklist=nouveau,nvidia,nvidiafb video=efifb:off"
```

Ensure that VFIO drivers are loaded:
```
echo -e "vfio\nvfio_pci\nvfio_virqfd" | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/vfio.conf
```

Bind VFIO drivers to GPUs. You need to first figure out the PCI vendor ID and device ID for GPUs.
To do so you can run `lspci -nnk | grep NVIDIA`. You'll see output like this (RTX 5090):
```
$ lspci -nnk | grep NVIDIA
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: NVIDIA Corporation Device [10de:2b85] (rev a1)
01:00.1 Audio device [0403]: NVIDIA Corporation Device [10de:22e8] (rev a1)
	Subsystem: NVIDIA Corporation Device [10de:0000]
```

Bind the VFIO to provided vendor IDs and device IDs on boot:
```
echo "options vfio-pci ids=10de:2b85,10de:22e8" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/vfio.conf
```

Finally, invoke:
```
sudo update-grub
sudo update-initramfs -u
```

Reboot.

After reboot check that VFIO drivers are in use. You can use `lspci -k | grep -A 2 -i nvidia` command
and should see `vfio` drivers in use:
```
81:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation Device 2b85 (rev a1)
	Subsystem: Gigabyte Technology Co., Ltd Device 416f
	Kernel driver in use: vfio-pci
	Kernel modules: nvidiafb, nouveau
81:00.1 Audio device: NVIDIA Corporation Device 22e8 (rev a1)
	Subsystem: NVIDIA Corporation Device 0000
	Kernel driver in use: vfio-pci
	Kernel modules: snd_hda_intel
```
