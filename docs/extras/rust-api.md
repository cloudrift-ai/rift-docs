# Rust API and Client

:::info

CloudRift is developed using Rust. Right now it is a monorepo containing all the code for the server, CLI,
communication  protocol, desktop app and the client library. We're working on splitting it into multiple
repositories and open-sourcing relevant components.

Please reach out in [Discord](https://discord.gg/u8YZZJXdnr) if you're interested in joining the team
or contributing to the project.
