# Getting Started

Fair Compute platform is a web service and a collection of tools that allows
you to turn your computers into a cluster that you can use for sharing with
other developers or for deployment.

If you're already using the cloud, you can leverage Fair to add some extra
compute to your backend during crunch times and save money since desktop
hardware is considerably cheaper than its cloud counterpart, and you likely
have some idle machines sitting in your office or at home.

In this tutorial, we will install Fair and launch our first job.

## Installation

### 1. Sign Up & Activate the Account

To start using Fair please sign-up at [faircompute.com](https://faircompute.com). It is free.

:::caution Activating Fair Account

We're actively working on scaling up Fair infrastructure, but the maximum number of users
on the platform is limited for now. The account needs to be activated. To get your activation -
please join our discord channel and ask for help in [#activation](https://discord.gg/JqjZPwrdZe).
A team member will help you to get the account activated.

### 2. Install Fair Desktop App

Install Fair Desktop application onto the machine you want to use to run jobs. Use fair CLI to schedule jobs.

### 3. Configure Credentials

Configure credentials using Fair command line tool by running
```shell
fair configure
```

You can also configure credentials using Fair desktop app.
To configure credentials, launch the app, <u>right-click on the tray icon</u> and click <u>change credentials</u>.

Lastly, you can edit the config manually. Location depends on your operating system.

    <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
        <pre>~/.config/faircompute/credentials.yml</pre>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 4. Install Docker

Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) if you're planning to use containers.
Note that only Docker engine is required, desktop app is optional.

:::info

  Fair needs to communicate with Docker engine. On Windows this is done via tcp connection.
  In Docker Settings -> General, ensure that **"Expose daemon on tcp://localhost:2375 without TLS"** is checked.

## Using Fair

### 1. Inspect the Cluster

Once you've authenticated and launched the client it is time to inspect the cluster.
Use `fair cluster info` command for this purpose. Ensure that you see details of all
the machines that you have launched Fair desktop application on.

```shell
fair cluster info
```

If cluster is empty, it means that no providers are running. You can start a provider
on a machine using `fair-desktop` command:
```shell
fair-desktop
```

Afterward `fair cluster info` command should show that you have at least one node in the cluster.

### 2. Run your First Task

To run the task on the cluster you can leverage `fair task` command:

```shell
fair docker run alpine echo "Hello Fair Compute"
```

If you need to see more details about program execution, pass `-vv` flag.
