### 4. Install Docker

Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) if you're planning to use containers.
Note that only Docker engine is required, desktop app is optional.

:::info

  Fair needs to communicate with Docker engine. On Windows this is done via tcp connection.
  In Docker Settings -> General, ensure that **"Expose daemon on tcp://localhost:2375 without TLS"** is checked.

## Using Fair

### 1. Inspect the Cluster

Once you've authenticated and launched the client it is time to inspect the cluster.
Use `fair cluster info` command for this purpose. Ensure that you see details of all
the machines that you have launched Fair desktop application on.

```shell
fair cluster info
```

### 2. Run your First Task

To run the task on the cluster you can leverage `fair task` command:

```shell
fair task -i alpine -- echo "Hello Fair Compute"
```

If you need to see more details about program execution, pass `-vv` flag.
