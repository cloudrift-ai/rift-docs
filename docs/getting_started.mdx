# Getting Started

CloudRift is a platform for workload orchestration and management across multiple clouds and devices.
It allows you to run your workloads on the most cost-effective cloud provider or on your own devices.

The platform consists of three main components tailored for different use cases:

1. [CloudRift CLI](./setup/cli) for accessing the platform.
2. [CloudRift Desktop](./setup/desktop) for managing your desktop computers and laptops.
3. [CloudRift Service](./setup/datacenter) for managing servers in your data center.
