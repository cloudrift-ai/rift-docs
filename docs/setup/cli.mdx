# Fair CLI

Fair CLI is a command line tool for managing cluster, running and inspecting jobs.

## Installing Fair CLI

### 1. Install Fair CLI

Install Fair CLI application onto your machine:

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="win" label="Windows">
    <a href="https://faircompute.com:8000/internal/release/fair-desktop-full/stable/windows-x86_64/latest/url">Download Windows Installer</a>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="mac" label="Mac">

  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

  ```shell

  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 2. Configure credentials

Configure credentials using Fair command line tool by running
```shell
fair configure
```

You can edit the config manually. Location depends on your operating system.
<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
    <TabItem value="win" label="Windows">
        <pre>%APPDATA%\Roaming\Fair Compute\credentials.yml</pre>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="mac" label="Mac">
        <pre>~/Library/Application Support/rs.fair-compute/credentials.yml</pre>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
        <pre>~/.config/faircompute/credentials.yml</pre>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>
<br/>

## Using Fair

### 1. Inspect the cluster

Once you've authenticated and launched the client it is time to inspect the cluster.
Use `fair cluster info` command for this purpose. Ensure that you see details of all
the machines that you have rented or launched Fair desktop application on.

```shell
fair cluster info
```

### 2. Run your first job

To run the job on the cluster you can leverage `fair docker run` command:

```shell
fair docker run alpine echo "Hello Fair Compute"
```

If you need to see more details about program execution, pass `-vv` flag.
