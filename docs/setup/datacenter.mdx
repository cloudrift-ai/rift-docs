# Fair Datacenter Service

Fair Datacenter Service is a system service that connects to the Fair platform allowing
you to manage and lease your datacenter computational resources. Together with Fair CLI,
Rest API, and other developer tools, it provides a comprehensive solution for managing your datacenter.

## Sign Up & Activate the Account

To start using Fair please sign-up at [faircompute.com](https://faircompute.com).

## Configuring Rentable Machines
