### 3. Install Docker

Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) if you're planning to use containers.
Note that only Docker engine is required, desktop app is optional.

:::info

  Fair needs to communicate with Docker engine. On Windows this is done via tcp connection.
  In Docker Settings -> General, ensure that **"Expose daemon on tcp://localhost:2375 without TLS"** is checked.

## Using Fair

### 1. Inspect the cluster

Once you've authenticated and launched the client it is time to inspect the cluster.
Use `fair cluster info` command for this purpose. Ensure that you see details of all
the machines that you have launched Fair desktop application on.

```shell
fair cluster info
```

If cluster is empty, it means that no providers are running. You can start a provider
on a machine using `fair-desktop` command:
```shell
fair-desktop
```

Afterward `fair cluster info` command should show that you have at least one node in the cluster.

### 2. Run your first job

To run the task on the cluster you can leverage `fair docker run` command:

```shell
fair docker run alpine echo "Hello Fair Compute"
```

If you need to see more details about program execution, pass `-vv` flag.
