### 3. Install Docker

Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) if you're planning to use containers.
Note that only Docker engine is required, desktop app is optional.

:::info

  CloudRift needs to communicate with Docker engine. On Windows this is done via tcp connection.
  In Docker Settings -> General, ensure that **"Expose daemon on tcp://localhost:2375 without TLS"** is checked.

## Using CloudRift

### 1. Inspect the cluster

Once you've authenticated and launched the client it is time to inspect the cluster.
Use `rift cluster info` command for this purpose. Ensure that you see details of all
the machines that you have launched CloudRift desktop application on.

```shell
rift cluster info
```

If cluster is empty, it means that no providers are running. You can start a provider
on a machine using `rift-desktop` command:
```shell
rift-desktop
```

Afterward `rift cluster info` command should show that you have at least one node in the cluster.

### 2. Run your first job

To run the task on the cluster you can leverage `rift docker run` command:

```shell
rift docker run alpine echo "Hello CloudRift"
```

If you need to see more details about program execution, pass `-vv` flag.
